        <h2>About Me Section</h2>
        <p>Welcome!!!! I'm Shani :), I'm a passionate artist who finds inspiration in the timeless works of Monet, Odilon Redon, and Takashi Murikami. I love poetry and I'm proud of the rich tapestry of my יהודי (being Jewish) and Black heritage. I'm from Bronzeville, and in my free time, I love to cook and draw.</p> <font color="000080">

        <p>I'm in eighth grade and currently I attend an IB school called Gems World Academy. Gems is an IB school and has helped me develop intellectual, personal, emotional, and social skills needed to live, learn, and work in a rapidly globalizing world. But in late 2024, I will be leaving Gems and I will go to Jones College Prep for High School, which is #3 in high school in Illinois.</p>

            <div>
                <p style="color: #FFFF;">Ever since I was little it seemed like I had a lifelong dedication to art. I appreciate how Art opens the mind to possibilities, supports the imagination, and allows you to experience the world differently. I've formulated this definition through my encounters with amazing and influential artists such as Nick Cave and early collaborations with Theaster Gates, this has not only honored my artistic skill but also nurtured a profound connection to the world around me. Through visual expression, I've been able to unlock various possibilities, perceptions, and historical contexts that shape both personal awareness and societal understanding. My art isn't just about strokes on a canvas. It is a portrait of different experiences and imagination. My art isn't just personal. My art could be a potential tool for fostering an inclusive environment at ____, where diverse perspectives, expression, and historical understanding cover and enrich the fabric of learning and social interactions. </p>
